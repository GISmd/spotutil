# spotutil
A collection of utilities working with Spotify playlists and more.

## ideas

Create a playlist class that can read a json file and can give you various useful outputs via methods using pandas. Possibly a spotify user class that could inherit any associated playlist classes when instantiated.

...there was something else I was going to add but I forgot...

Possible useful methods:
- Return tracks with a given release year or range of years.
- Return tracks matching certain values in any columns (i.e. if artist name=="Rhye" or if trackPopularity > x...)
- Methods for returning plots on the playlist data (histograms and scatter plots)
